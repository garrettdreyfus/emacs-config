\subsection{Calculations}
\label{sec:orge993084}
WF Q12.1 tells us we can use the equation \(\rho * C_p \Delta\theta *T\) where T is volume transport in \(m^3s^{-1}\).
We can treat \(\rho\) and C\textsubscript{p} as constants with values \(1025.0 \frac{kg}{m^3}\) and \(3850 \frac{J}{kg K}\)
Let's use the North Atlantic values from WFQ12.1

\begin{itemize}
\item Mid latitude Gyre (MLG)
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\Delta\theta = 2K\)
\item \(T = 30 Sv\)
\end{itemize}
\item Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC)
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\Delta\theta = 15K\)
\item \(T = 15 Sv\)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

So heat transport for the each is:

\(HT_{MLG} = 1025.0 \frac{kg}{m^3} * 3850 \frac{J}{kg K} * 2K * 30 Sv = 236.8 TW\)

\(HT_{MOC} = 1025.0 \frac{kg}{m^3} * 3850 \frac{J}{kg K} * 15K * 15 Sv = 887.9 TW\)

\subsection{Discussion of sensitivity}
\label{sec:org7c452f9}
I would expect the equations to be relatively insensitive to variations in the actual density and heat capacity. Here we treated them as constants that are invariant with depth and location. They of course vary but probably by less than 1\% of their total value. Out of the transport and the temperature gradient it seems that the temperature gradient is the more important/sensitive quantity. The MOC and MLG differ in transport by a factor of 2, but differ in temperature gradient by a factor of 7.5.

\subsection{Qualitative}
\label{sec:orgffb2e4a}
Without  loss of generality let's focus on the Northern Hemisphere. In the Northern Hemisphere water the balance between pressure gradient force and the coriolis acceleration drives geostrophic velocitys 90 degrees to the right of the pressure gradient. So for the overturning circulation in the northern hemisphere which has water going poleward at the surface and equatorward at depth we would expect \(\frac{dP}{dx}\) to be positive at the surface (increasing eastward) and negative at depth (increasing westward).

\subsection{Quantitative}
\label{sec:orge5b8fef}
Following WF12.2 we can define the total meridional transport by \(\int_{-d_{ref}}^{z=0} \int_{x_w}^{x_e} v_g dxdz\). Substituting in the geostrophic relation \(\frac{1}{\rho_0 f}*\frac{dP}{dx} = v_g\)

\(T_{MOC} = \int_{-d_{ref}}^{z=0} \int_{x_w}^{x_e} \frac{1}{\rho_0 f}*\frac{dP}{dx}  dxdz\)

\(T_{MOC} = \frac{1}{\rho_0 f} * \int_{-d_{ref}}^{z=0} \int_{x_w}^{x_e} \frac{dP}{dx}  dxdz\)

\(T_{MOC} = \frac{1}{\rho_0 f} * \int_{-d_{ref}}^{z=0} (P(x_e)-P(x_w)) dz\)

So using the estimate of 15 Sv as the volume transport of the MOC in the northern hemisphere, we can estimate the pressure gradient by assuming its constant to the level of no motion (it has to reverse underneath the level of no motion to drive water equatorward at depth). Let the level of no motion be about 2500m.

$$(P(x_e)-P(x_w)) = \frac{T_{MOC}*(\rho_0*f)}{d_{ref}} \approx 0.03 dbar \approx 3 cm $$

That means we'd expect a very small 3cm difference between the eastern and western boundary which seems about right.

$$\omega \frac{dT}{dz} = \kappa \frac{d T^2}{d z^2} \approx \omega \frac{T}{H} = \kappa \frac{T}{Hz^2^2} \implies \omega = \frac{\kappa}{H}$$

$$ \beta *v = f \frac{d\omega}{dz} \approx  v = f \frac{\omega}{H * \beta}$$ 

$$ v = f \frac{\omega}{H * \beta} \approx  f \frac{k}{H^2 * \beta} $$

$$\omega = \frac{\kappa}{H} \approx \frac{10^{-4} m^2 s^{-1}}{3000m} \approx 3.333 * 10^{-8} m s^{-1}$$
let f = 10\textsuperscript{-4} s\textsuperscript{-1} and \(\beta\) = 10\textsuperscript{-11} s\textsuperscript{-1} m\textsuperscript{-1}
$$v = f \frac{\omega}{H * \beta} \approx  10^{-4} s^{-1} * \frac{3.333 * 10^{-8} m s^{-1}}{3000m * 10^{-11} s^{-1} m^{-1}} \approx 1.1*10^{-4} m s^{-1}$$
$$ T = v*H*L_x = 1.1*10^{-4} m s^{-1}*3000 m * 5000000 m = 1.65 Sv$$

A larger mixing value on the eastern boundary would drive more velocity and more transport on the eastern side of the basin. This would mean interior flows would be mostly zonal.

\label{sec:org2aef63c}
I would say the Stommel-Aarons model gives a great first approximation of abyssal ocean circulation. It doesn't account for the complications of topography, both due to mixing and the change in vorticity (see QG model). I think the model does allow for changes in the mixing coefficient but our simple implementation of it doesn't. Is really looking at large spatial scale large temporal scale abyssal flows. 

\section{{\bfseries\sffamily TODO} }
\label{sec:org8d1d73e}
The two main ingredients for growth in the euphotic zone are light and nutrients.

To carry out photosynthesis phytoplankton need light. The amount of light available to them is a function of the light available at the surface, and how deep the mixed surface layer is. Even if there are high amounts of light in the surface layer, phytoplankton which have limited mobility, can end up light deprived if they are mixed too far beneath the euphotic zone. Geographically the closer to the equator phytoplankton they are the more sunlight they get. Seasonally, phytoplankton receive more sunlight in the spring and summer, and there is less deeper mixing.

Phytoplankton also require nutrients. Some nutrients such as nitrate and phosphate are primarily sourced from deeper waters, whereas more terrestial sediments like iron come from dust from the continents. Upwelling or deep mixing can supply phytoplankton with the nitrate and phosphate they need but getting iron requires being downwind of a continental source like a desert. The southern ocean while having no shortage of upwelling, has a hard time finding iron.

The interplay of nutrient and light availability drive the spring time bloom in primary productivity. The deep mixing during the winter brings nutrients to the euphotic zone, but it is only when there is more sun and shallower mixing depths that the phytoplankton are able to feast on their food. The bloom eventually kills it sell off once it eats up the nutrients.

Zooplankton grazing reduces phytoplankton productivity but not by much.

I'm going to use the equations from the slides and then plug it into a computer! Sagemath if you were wondering

\begin{verbatim}

sage: D = 2100
sage: A = 2300
sage: f1 = C1 + C2 + C3
sage: f2 = C2 + 2 * C3 - H
sage: f3 = C1 / pC
sage: f4 = (C2 * H) / C1
sage: f5 = (C3 * H) / C2
sage: K0 = 0.033
sage: K1 = 1.3*(10^-6)
sage: K2 = (9.1) * (10 ^ -10)
sage: solve([f1 == D, f2 == A, f3 == K0, f4 == K1, f5 == K2], C1, C2, C3, H, pC)
\end{verbatim}
Plugging all that in and converting [H] to pH, with D=2100, and A=2300 the \textbf{pH is 8.09}

If we run that again but with D=2200, and A=2300 we get that the \textbf{pH is 7.82}
