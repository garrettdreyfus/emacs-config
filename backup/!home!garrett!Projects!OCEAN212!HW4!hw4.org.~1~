* Discretization
  - I used a second order centered in space for discretizing the jacobian. I used the Arakawa jacobian and AB3 to solve for vorticity.
  - In order to solve the poisson problem I directly inverted the matrix once to find A^{-1} and then just multiplied by that every loop iteration instead of using an iterative solver. I figured this would be faster and when its all said and done easier.
  - I didn't end up using/needing a viscous term


* Default experiment (vorticity on top stream function on bottom for all animations)
  - file name: default.gif
  - The vortexs clearly merge. I found it interesting how there was so much more structure in the PV graph than the stream function graph. Makes sense but still interesting to see.
    
* Half radius experiment
  - file name: half-radius.gif
  - Vortices interact significantly less
  - Looks alright though

* Opposite sign vortices experiment
  - file name: opposite-sign.gif
  - The radiuses are slightly constrained by the domain.
  - It seems they are traveling in the same direction (up and to the left) but then recirculate within the box.
  - Quite cool!
  
* Topography experiment
  - file name: topo.gif
  - Tried to go all out on this one!
  - The initial vorticity set up is basically a shock with half the domain set to 1 and half to 0.
    - I wanted to see if I could get something like kelvin-helmholtz instability
  - The topography underneath is a checkerboard of 4x4 super high mountains
    - [[./topomap.png]]
  - In the simulation you can see the topography cause wakes as the flow passes over it.
