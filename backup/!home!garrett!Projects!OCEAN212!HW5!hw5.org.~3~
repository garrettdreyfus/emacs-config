* Spectral Method
  I did the Fourier Galerkin with AB3 dealiasing and full factorization of diffusion. At 32 modes its a bit rough but noticably better at 256 modes. 
  - 32 modes
    - file name: spectral32.gif
    - $\Delta t$: 0.01
    - Run time: 13.7 seconds
  - 256 modes
    - file name: spectral256.gif
    - $\Delta t$: 0.01
    - Run time: 11.99 seconds (somehow faster don't ask me how)

      
* Finite Difference
  I chose to do the second option which was euler forward time discretization with an upwind differentiation scheme and Euler backwards. I was really surprised by how well it performed.

  - 256 modes

    - $\Delta t$: 0.001
    - Run time: 19.7 seconds (somehow faster don't ask me how)
