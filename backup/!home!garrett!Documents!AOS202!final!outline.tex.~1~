My aim in this paper is to provide a whirlwind tour of hydraulic control of rotating fluids and briefly try my own hand at estimating whether ice shelf cavities are hydraulically controlled. Much of the background summary information comes from Whitehead and Pratt's "Rotating Hydraulics", I then discuss Whitehead 1973, and Zhao 2019.

In class much of our discussion of ocean dynamics was set in the large ocean interior where water is able to move more or less freely constrained only by the size of the basin. In the hydraulically controlled case, the circulation is fundamentally altered (controlled really) by the presence of an obstruction in its way. In Whitehead and Pratt's "Rotating Hydraulics" they begin with a discussion of the flow of information propagation along the flow. Below (Figure 1) is an example of a hydraulically controlled flow over a dam. One can imagine that if we were to start with the water surface in the shape of Figure 1 ,  we'd expect the water to equilibrate to be driven horizontal by surface gravity waves in no time especially down stream of the dam where the surface is nearly vertical. In the hydraulically controlled case where there is a significant up stream velocity which only accelerates as it passes over the dam the water is travelling faster than surface gravity waves and therefore whatever is happening downstream of the dam does not affect what is happening up stream. When the velocity of the flow exceeds the velocity of the waves it is dubbed \emph{supercritical}, when the velocity is less than the speed of the waves the flow is \emph{subcritical}, and when the velocity is equivalent to the speed of the waves such that they are frozen in space the flow is \emph{critical}.
