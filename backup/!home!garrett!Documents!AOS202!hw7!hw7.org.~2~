   Potential Energy = $\int \rho g dz$
  
   Change in potential energy after mixing:
  
   $$\Delta PE = g(\rho_a*z_a + \rho_b*z_b) - g(\rho_a*z_b + \rho_b*z_a)$$
  
   $$\Delta PE = g(\rho_a - \rho_b)*(z_a-z_b)$$
  
   There are two angles we care about. The angle of the isopycnals \phi and the angle of parcel exchange \alpha.

   We can assume that both angles are very small compared to the vertical displacement \Delta z . This means we can approximate sin(\alpha) as \alpha and cos(\alpha) as 1. 

   $$\Delta \rho = \Delta y * \frac{d\rho}{dy} + \Delta z * \frac{d\rho}{dz} = L*cos(\alpha) * cos(\alpha)*\frac{d\rho}{dy} + L*sin(\alpha)*\frac{d\rho}{dz} = L* \frac{d\rho}{dy} + L*\alpha*\frac{d\rho}{dz}$$
  
   $$\Delta PE = g(\Delta \rho)*(\Delta z) = g*\alpha*L*(L* \frac{d\rho}{dy} + L*\alpha*\frac{d\rho}{dz})$$
   $$\Delta PE = g*\alpha*L^2*(1-\frac{\alpha}{\phi})$$

   So change in potential energy is 0 when alpha is 0 or it stirs along isopycnals.

   First lets find \phi.
   $$ \phi = -\frac{d\rho}{dy}/\frac{d\rho}{dz}$$
   That's really just the slope of the isopycnal
   $$ \phi \approx \frac{400m}/{2*111000m} = 0.0018$$

   Let's choose the maximum kinetic energy scenario where \alpha = \phi/2.

   Then $$\Delta PE = \frac{g\alpha L^2}{2}\frac{d\rho}{dy} \approx \frac{9.8 ms^{-2} * 0.0009 * 2*111000}{2}\frac{0.6 kg m^{-3}}{2*111000 m} = 1174 J m^{-3}$$

   From there we can calculate the change in velocity for the fluid parcel as $$\Delta PE = \Delta KE == \bar{\rho}*\Delta v ^2 $$
