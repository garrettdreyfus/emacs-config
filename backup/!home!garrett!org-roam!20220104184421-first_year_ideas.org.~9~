* Meeting notes
** 10/14 meeting
   - Maybe I should reach out to ruth, would like to read EW AS paper
   - MisoMip
     - ice modelling is hard
   - Geometric and oceanographic controls on melting beneath PIG
     - static ice shelf is very interesting....
     - maybe the reason people haven't done this is because coupled ice models are really hard to model
     - their model setup is similar to what I was thinking
     - Figure 4 is cool
     - find figure orientation confusing
     - dont like salinity colorbar figure 5
     - rabbit hole of learning about ice
     - shows something... I guess?
     - Temperature inversion is interesting....
     - no dense water production right?
     - Maybe already initializing in a particular state
   - On the role of coastal troughs
     - Three mechanisms
       - meridional meltdriven flow
       - interaction of mean flow with topography
       - rossby wave and topography
       - this to me is no offense classic ice shelf cavity paper
** 10/21 meeting
   - any thoughts on ML project? ICE stuff?
   - To read
     - subglacial plumes https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-fluid-010719-060252
     - https://www.nature.com/articles/nature20825
       - tidal resonance AA
       - tidal resonance ice shelf cavities
       - ok obviously this isn't a thesis project.... but why isn't there like a truly ice ocean model?
       - mmmm this one is confusing to me, maybe im struggling with the personification
       - rising theres rotation instabilitiy created it diffuses stays low
     - De rydt 2016 https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2015JF003791
       - At each coupling time step, the ice shelf geometry is transferred to MITgcm, which is spun up to a new steady state, and values for the updated ice shelf fresh water ﬂux are used by Úa to advance the ice geometry until the next coupling time step. We show that results for this approach converge in the limit of a small coupling time step, and the method is optimized to simulate the inherent feedbacks between cavity geometry,
	 - are you gonna get like continuous phenomena?
	 - seems kinda not real
       - Interesting that these papers look at what would happen if water became cold again. Seems hopeful? was this like in vogue in years past
       - factor of 10 melt rate difference
       - Figure 11 shows discontinuity I assume due to coupling scheme
       - hmmmmm... why is it so hard to just actually couple ice and ocean? Both are water (jk)

    - https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8013649
    - sea ice drift
    - sea ice production rates
    - ocean hydrographic
    - thermocline depth
    - why are some ice shelves warm and some are cold and what controls that
    - highest isobath whcih spans ice sheet
    - bathymetric breadfirst search find shallowest isobath
** 11/4 meeting
*** for every ice production spot figure out if its enclosed by BFS out from depth at that point and see if it hits sea. Then if it doesn't add that to running sum. That might be the metric right there.
** 1/6 meeting
   - what matters really is pycnocline depth/ thermocline depth
   - CDW investigation
     - how much do they vary
     - time dependence
     - part of story but not whole story

** 1/27 meeting
    - Choosing grounding line points
    - sorting by shallower first
    - using label function
    - Surprising no points in Ronne
      - but actually makes sense, grounding line points there are elevated above.

* Model notes 
  - Time step calculation seems to be off - dt is too large
    - calculation of delta t small enough to caputre everything
  - Low confidence on sea ice parameters, e.g. advection scheme, albedos
    - *No idea where they came from*
  - Configurable hydrographic profiles
  - Consider grid refinement
  - Atmospheric properties very approximate - should look at reanalyses to estimate range
  - I have more Matlab codes that may be useful - just ask!
  - Maybe domain should be longer?
  - Maybe sea ice should have no slip boundary conditions
  - Could need some stochasticity in the winds to prevent sea ice buildup in awkward places
  - Sea ice LSR error may not need to be so low (may be slowing down computation unnecessarily)
    - maximum error thats allowed to solve implicit momentum budget at boundary
  - Should we imposed finite sea ice thickness offshore to hinder offshore advection?
  - Should switch to using model EOS to compute N^2 - I’m worried that the northern boundary profile might be statically unstable, leading to convection (or there may be some strong surface fluxes associated with the sea ice sponge)
  - Hasn't turned on Frazil package
  - Probably higher resolution
  - better atmospheric properties
  - longer domain
