    In the Antarctic warm salty water which has the heat required to melt ice shelves from below lies underneath cold fresh water. Human caused climate change is warming this water and making it more shallow. Understanding how this warm water is able to, and will be able to access the grounding line of ice shelves is essential to predicting future melt.

    Can we estimate with any skill the mass loss of an ice shelf solely from the shape of its bathymetry and the depth of warm water at the shelf break?

    In this work we have shown through observations and numerical modelling that the bathymetry of an ice shelf is an
