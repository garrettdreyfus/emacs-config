first probably set everything offshore to flat 2000 m so its all one node

dictionary of regions to point

slice at deepest level

slice again
unique identifier = 0
1 dictionary = {regions:{depth:depthslice}}
2 dictionary = {regions:{parent regions}}
by region:
    if every point in region was previously in one region, or not in any region, just add depth slice of points in that region
    if every point in region was not previously in one region, connect those two regions to this new one and add depth slice of points to that region
