* Short Form Paper Outline
  
** Figure 1) Station locations, and existing schematics of flow around RGR
   - Introductory discussion of previous work in the basin
     - Previous proposed circulations drawn on map.
   - Brief description of inverse method, it's strengths, its limitations etc...
** Figure 2) GAM vs neutral depths along A23 and A10 (two panel?)
   - Discussion of how the approximate neutral surfaces are constructed
   - Discussion of GAM interpolation and its performance in the figure
     - particularly important to note the lack of boundary current resolution mentioned above
       - Choice of spline made visually, and by graphing error. Settled on 40 splines.
       - Also mapped neutrality error of surfaces
       - Maybe the error curves could be included in a supplement....
   - Maybe worth highlighting which surfaces are actually included in the inverse.
** Figure 3) Bubble cross section of transport. Zonal and meridional, Yomaha and inverse. Include 2C isotherm?
   - Here we get to point out our main feature, the circulation around the RGR
     - Consistent with that mudwave paper
     - It's existence in both the inverse and the Yomaha referenced velocity cross sections is compelling
     - Worth noting that this feature changed in strength but remained present when we changed pretty much any parameter including:
       - inclusion of mixing
       - initial reference station
       - number of splines of interpolation (this one probably mattered most but had same outcome)
       - Reference level
     - Note the similarities/differences with Hernandez-Guerra and Talley paper.
       - Include in this a discussion of the 2C isoterm

** Figure 4) Our schematic of transport with boundary currents added in dashed lines
   - A discussion of the difference in basin wide mixing budgets (Morris) would be nice here
     - May be worthwhile to do those budgets with inverse transport values and Yomaha transport values
     - Compare to inverses mixing values?
   - Discuss how the inverse is still consistent with float studies in shallower reference levels

** Conclusion
   - The absolute geostrophic velocity of the inverse model, and referencing the shear to Yomaha velocity both suggest that there is a cyclonic circulation around the Rio Grande Rise.
   - This reduces the mixing budget in the Brazil Basin

* Sensitivity Study
  
** Variables
     - [X] Reference Level
     - [X] H_0
     - [X] Column weighting (one order of magnitude
     - [X] Upper bound , lower bound
     - [X] inclusion of mixing at all
     - [X] Gaussian Noise on NS pressure (for fun!) (also already built in?)
     - [X] Reference Station choice
     - [X] Grid resolution
** Metrics
     + Condition
     + Error
     + Negative diffusivity percentage
     + Transport below 2C East of RGR
     + Average Diffusivity
* Notes for 10/11 meeting
  - need correct neutrality error citation will message geoff
  - question about second transport fixing technique
