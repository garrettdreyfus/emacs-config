\section{Discretization}
\label{sec:orgac7161f}
\begin{itemize}
\item I used a second order centered in space for discretizing the jacobian. I used the Arakawa jacobian and AB3 to solve for vorticity.
\item In order to solve the poisson problem I directly inverted the matrix once to find A\textsuperscript{-1} and then just multiplied by that every loop iteration instead of using an iterative solver. I figured this would be faster and when its all said and done easier.
\item I didn't end up using/needing a viscous term
\end{itemize}


\section{Default experiment (vorticity on top stream function on bottom for all animations)}
\label{sec:orgf6e8df4}
\begin{itemize}
\item file name: default.gif
\item The vortexs clearly merge. I found it interesting how there was so much more structure in the PV graph than the stream function graph. Makes sense but still interesting to see.
\end{itemize}

\section{Half radius experiment}
\label{sec:orgde8162d}
\begin{itemize}
\item file name: half-radius.gif
\item Vortices interact significantly less
\item Looks alright though
\end{itemize}

\section{Opposite sign vortices experiment}
\label{sec:org6908ab4}
\begin{itemize}
\item file name: opposite-sign.gif
\item The radiuses are slightly constrained by the domain.
\item It seems they are traveling in the same direction (up and to the left) but then recirculate within the box.
\item Quite cool!
\end{itemize}

\section{Topography experiment}
\label{sec:orgfe0bed0}
\begin{itemize}
\item file name: topo.gif
\item Tried to go all out on this one!
\item The initial vorticity set up is basically a shock with half the domain set to 1 and half to 0.
\begin{itemize}
\item I wanted to see if I could get something like kelvin-helmholtz instability
\end{itemize}
\item The topography underneath is a checkerboard of 4x4 super high mountains
\item In the simulation you can see the topography cause wakes as the flow passes over it.
\end{itemize}
